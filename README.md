## About Blackafe

ðŸš€ This is a Blackafe website, which I created during my first year of college, particularly when I was in the initial stages of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, especially focusing on responsive designs.
  
ðŸš€ From that time until now, I haven't made a single change to this website. I've kept it as a memory ðŸ˜Š of my first website, which sparked my interest in web development.

ðŸš€ Initially, I used floats and positions to build the entire layout of the website. As I became more familiar with flexbox and grid layouts, I transitioned to using these techniques exclusively for layout design.
  
ðŸš€ I implemented a loader using CSS animations and transitions. When the website starts, the loader screen appears and remains until the entire website is fully loaded in the background. Once the loading is complete, the loader screen disappears, revealing the website content.

ðŸš€ I utilized CSS animations, transitions, and the transform property to create special effects such as hover and visited states, as well as for the loader animation.
  
ðŸš€ Additionally, I used HTML entities to include the copyright symbol.
  
ðŸš€ The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.

ðŸ¤© Overall, it's been a significant journey from creating this website as a beginner to where I am now in my web development skills.
